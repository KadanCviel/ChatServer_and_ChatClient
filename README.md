# ChatServer_and_ChatClient
command line chat application "client"" and "server" write in c implement with "select" (or can  compile to use "poll")

run the "server" then run the "clients"


For compilation install "cygwin" and select "gcc" package to be install


//$./server.exe PORT_NUM    (if the parameter is missing it will use 8888 as PORT_NUM)
//$./server.exe 7777
// use cygwin1.dll (take sygwin dll x86  and not 64_x86 dll)in the same folder. 
// from cmd> line.
// >server.exe PORT_NUM



for runninng:

cmd
cd c:\MyData\Server_Client\Client
client.exe

type 
help:

NAME:new_name
Add the <new_name> to server list,
so registered clients will be able

by using its <new_name>.

name:message
Will send the <message> to specific client <name>.

LIST:
Will show a list of all registered clients.

ALL:message
The <message> will broadcast to all registered clients.

ECHO:off/on
off (0) (default) server will not send back to client received chars as feedback.
on  (1)           server send back to client received chars as feedback.

CR:off/on
off (0)(default) dont show non printable chars, skip <CR><LF>.
on  (1)          show all recevied characters include <CR><LF>.

BYE:
Leave without notice to anyone.



for Client compilation:
cd C:\\MyData\\Server_Client\\Client
gcc -o client client.c
# copy to the compiled "client.exe" folder the "cygwin1.dll" file
# from "C:\cygwin64\bin" cygwin istalled folder

For the server compilation :
#define USE_SELECT 
//Allow the define above definition will cause to work with socket "select()" function (the old way)
//Undefined above definition will cause to work with socket "poll()" function (instead of "select()")

 run "Cygwin64 Terminal" get the "$" prompt:
  $ cd C:\\MyData\\Server_Client\\Server
  make
  make clean
 copy to the compiled "server.exe" the "cygwin1.dll" file
 from "C:\cygwin64\bin" cygwin istalled folder
 if you complile with another cyggwin e.g. 32 bit cygwin need to use the 32bit "cygwin1.dll"
 mixing 32bit "cygwin1.dll"  with "server.exe" compile 64 bit will crash.
